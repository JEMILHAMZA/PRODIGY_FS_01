# Secure User Authentication System

This project implements a secure authentication system that supports role-based access control for users and administrators. It provides features for user and admin account creation, login functionality, and protection for restricted routes based on user roles.

## Features

### User Authentication
- Secure registration and login for users and admins using encrypted credentials.

### Protected Routes
- Access to certain routes is restricted to authenticated users only, ensuring unauthorized users cannot access sensitive information.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Admin Role**: Admins have full control, including the ability to create, read, and update events.
- **User Role**: Regular users are limited to viewing events, with no permission to make changes.
